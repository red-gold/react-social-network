# Motivation

As my target in this project, I've intended to make a social network with features of new and powerful web technologies such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). As my principles I [don't use jquery](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-use-React-with-jQuery) so it's a good a challenge for me to think in React structure and principles. And another feature that I love in react that is `Component-Based`. I use this cool feature to have a [loosely coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) system. Similar angular components these components are also [stateful](https://toddmotto.com/stateful-stateless-components). Using [Redux]() makes everything more delicious that you make your components more loosely coupled. More and more of these cool features have motivated me to use them in this project.
